# DL_Project
Deep Learning course final project
The project aim is to use a three-part neural network for Latex formula images synthesis into formula text. The library used in this project is PyTorch. The architecture of the network is presented in the link below:

My model has reached the bleu score of 0.65 and edit distance score of 0.68. I also have compiled some of the formulas obtained by the model from some input images back to Latex formula which is provided below.
